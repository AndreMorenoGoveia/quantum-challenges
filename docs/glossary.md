# Glossary

**Qubit** – The fundamental unit of quantum information, analogous to a classical bit but able to exist in a superposition of states.

**Superposition** – A property allowing qubits to be in multiple states simultaneously until measured.

**Entanglement** – A correlation between quantum systems such that the state of one cannot be described independently of the state of another.

**Quantum Gate** – A basic quantum circuit operation that manipulates qubits, similar to logic gates in classical computing.

**Measurement** – The process of observing a quantum system, which collapses its state to a classical outcome.
