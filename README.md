# Quantum Challenges

Welcome to the **quantum-challenges** repository! This project contains a collection of hands-on exercises designed to help you learn quantum computing by solving real problems.

Each challenge is organized in its own directory under `challenges/` and typically includes:

- A `README.md` describing the problem, theory, and steps to build the solution.
- Implementations in various frameworks (e.g. OpenQASM, Qiskit, Cirq) under `solution-*/`.
- Tests in `tests/` to validate your implementation.
- A `results/` folder to store metrics and plots.
- A `meta.yaml` file with metadata (difficulty, topics, estimated time, etc.).

Additional shared utilities live in the `src/` directory.

See `docs/overview.md` for an overview of the project and `docs/glossary.md` for definitions of key quantum concepts.
